Graphs:

Simple Grapggs
- no self loops
- only 1 edge between 2 vertices 
G = (V, E) V: finite set
if cardinality is V = E - sparse
if cardinality of E = v^2 - dense graph

-length of path - distance between 2 points
- traverse/search
-remove v or e
insert v or e
determine if it has a cycle
adjacency
- empty
Vertices -- Data, edges

Edges - weighted, vertices connecting, direction
